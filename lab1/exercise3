1. Which command (and its options) are used to completely remove an empty directory?

To completely remove an empty directory, one would use the "rmdir" command.
"--ignore-fail-on-non-empty" does not output error messages for failures caused by non-empty directories.
"-p" removes all directories in a path if they are empty. rmdir -p a/b/c would remove directories
a, b and c.
"-v" outputs a diagnostic for every directory processed
"--help" displays available optional commands
"--version" outputs version information


2. What would you type in your terminal to learn more about command "pwd"?

"pwd --help" would output available optional commands.
"man pwd" gives you a full overview of what the command does, how to format potential options
and other parameters, and all available optional commands. It also includes a link to the
full documentation.
